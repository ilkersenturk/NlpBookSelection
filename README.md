# NlpBookSelection



In this project, I want to demonstrate how Natural Language Processing can help us. There are five pages in it.


Page 1:

There are 2 books, one is a .txt file and another is to be extracted from a webpage

Which book should I be reading?

* Simple approach is to find words that occur most frequently throughout each document and compare which one is more appealing to the user

Page 2:    

* How do people feel about this book? 

* Reviews will be collected from the web by using Selenium or Beautiful Soup Library

Using Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes for supervised sentiment analysis

We will use the NLTK reviews data set for training purposes

Page 3:

* Topic Modelling
The Gensim library is ideal for topic modeling

Page 4

* Document Search
There will be an implementation of Word2Veck
